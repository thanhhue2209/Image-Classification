# Image-Classification
Train dataset includes labeled images. It consists of 6 labels: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, Street.

The test data set includes 3000 unlabeled images. My mission is to build a model to  identify its label. Here, I use the model Inceptionresnetv2 and have the result with 0.91 accuracy.
